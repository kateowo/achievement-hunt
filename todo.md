# general todo for AH

pre-game period as usual. upon start, players are placed into a 5 minute grace period to gather general resources. once that timer is up, a random achievement is picked (and announced to the user as a title, in chat, and on a (bossbar/actionbar)). after (set amount of time), if no player has earned the achievement a new one is picked; if a player earns the achievement in the set amount of time, they will earn point(s), first to x points wins (similar to bounty-hunt)
